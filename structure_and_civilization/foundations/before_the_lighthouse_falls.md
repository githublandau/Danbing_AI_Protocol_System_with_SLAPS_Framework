## 写在灯塔倒塌之前
### Before the Lighthouse Falls

世界愈发纷乱莫测，有感而发，个人随笔。

灯塔，象征着二战后以欧美为核心倡导的民主、自由与平等的价值观体系，曾在过去七十多年里照亮全球秩序。然而，这光芒正在消逝。本文谈谈世界、谈谈中国、谈谈AI，试图探讨这一时代转折中的危机与机遇。

谈谈世界

过去的七十多年在人类历史上是独一无二的黄金时代，在欧洲和北美洲，人类社会大致实现了第一次普世化的和平，自由，平等和保障，人们普遍享有了不被权力任意支配的自由，成为全世界人们的向往之地。但从历史看，这只是很短暂而又特别例外的一个时期，其核心实质源于基督教的普世主义传承，其动因源于当时的社会现实：战后欧洲对两次大战痛彻心扉的 Never Again 反思和美国人威尔逊式的战略天真—己所欲，应施予人。不可否认，这确实是人类历史上文明和价值观的一个美好版本。
七十年来，虽然人们经常嘴上会调侃嘲讽一下文明灯塔的傻气，但每每事到临头，身体还是非常诚实。威尔逊体系的原生缺陷在于，就像宇宙是趋向于熱寂的，这个特例般的大众民主的黄金时代本身是趋于荒漠化的。一杯热水和一杯冷水，混合后自然地会变成一杯温水。而没有外力作用的话，两杯温水不会自发地变成一杯热水和一杯冷水。过去七十年的美国就是那个外力。
如今，在这个时代谢幕的边缘，目前还有两个未知：美国内部的全球主义者们是否真的也愿意放弃，任由灯塔倒塌，回到美洲岛生存方式，如近年孤立主义抬头所示；以及欧洲是否会走向联邦化，成为全球化现代共和罗马的下一个君士坦丁堡——难度非常大，仅军事装备标准体系一项，欧洲就有150种之多。历史从来不在乎什么好人坏人，那只是大众媒体渲染的娱乐故事，历史只论利弊，洪流之下，只看你当时的位置和选择，无论是个体还是集体。也许，对于很多人而言，灯塔的倒塌意味着世界将再无那个人们嘴上嘲讽，内心认可的庇佑之地。整个世界，哪里也都不会再给你几乎免费的提供之前那份能偷着乐的内心安全感了。

谈谈中国

中国社会出于自身历史发展阶段的制约，在完成首次全面工业化后选择了走向了霍布斯体系—主权至上，国家至上，国家的绝对威权是保障个人安全的唯一可信依靠，人们普遍相信“己所不欲，勿施于人”就是最具现实意义的最高道德标准。这几年，中国在自我拉扯中逐渐走向伟大帝国复兴方向，拉扯源于自身矛盾而又多元的价值观体系的内耗——儒家的仁义、社会主义的平等与市场经济的个人主义彼此冲突，此外也有对自身真实实力的一点忐忑。
最终，如果灯塔的倒塌成为了现实，那么，中国社会将出现一次价值观全面重塑的社会运动，届时，重建中华帝国也许会成为最主流的思潮——从这几年的被广泛传播的爱国主义，民族主义和复仇主义情绪来看。帝国的荣光和荫庇可以为帝国臣民带来荣耀感和保护伞，同时也意味着负担和责任。从历史经验看，帝国是一种秩序消耗型社会组织模式，依赖不断扩张和边疆资源消耗保持续存，总是出现周期性的轮替，中国2000多年的历史中不断发生的王朝周期轮回就很好的说明了这一点。帝国之内，帝都之外，皆是边疆。同时，走帝国之路也意味着上世纪昭和帝国的现实问题同样摆在中国面前，南下还是北上，抑或全部都要？无论何种选择，中国需在扩张，内政和外交之间找到平衡，避免历史悲剧的反复重演。

谈谈AI

现阶段AI对生产力和生产效率的提升已表现出10倍甚至100倍的提升，也许不用等到AI造反毁灭人类，仅仅是天量的人类因为AI普及应用而失去了赖以生存工作和收入，同时由于这一切在非常短的时间里发生，不像以前的技术革命，至少还有一代人甚至更多世代的时间来缓冲消化，AI的极速应用可能导致5-10年内就出现普遍性的失业和失序现象，而社会根本来不及适应，产业也来不及改造的现实困境。国际劳工组织预测，未来十年内全球20%的岗位或被取代——坦率讲，我觉得ILO大大低估了这一数字，AI已在几乎每一个领域展露威力。
现在看上去，让AI发展和应用慢一点显然做不到。给每个失业人口发钱，很多地方可能也做不到。那么，世界会走向通过战争来互相掠夺资源，消灭过剩人口以重启社会和经济循环——如当前大国博弈的紧张局势所示；还是走向恒星系移民和开发，来创造新生存空间——就像SpaceX的星际计划所尝试——尽管技术与资金仍是难题。面对这样一个未来趋势，整个社会该如何抉择，个人又如何适应并生存？

交织与展望
灯塔的倒塌、中国的帝国之路与AI冲击彼此交织，历史洪流之下，英雄永远只是个别特例。诸多个体与集体都需思考自己的位置与选择，在扑面而来的新时代中寻找生存之道。

Before the Lighthouse Falls

The world grows ever more chaotic and unpredictable, prompting these reflections in a personal essay.

The lighthouse, symbolizing the democratic, free, and egalitarian value system championed by Europe and North America since World War II, has illuminated global order for over seventy years. Yet, that light is now fading. This essay discusses the world, China, and AI, seeking to explore the crises and opportunities within this era’s turning point.

On the World
Over the past seventy-odd years, human history witnessed a unique golden age. In Europe and North America, human society largely achieved, for the first time, a universalized peace, freedom, equality, and security. People broadly enjoyed freedom from arbitrary domination by power, making these regions the envy of the world. But from a historical perspective, this is merely a brief and particularly exceptional period. Its core essence stems from the universalist legacy of Christianity, driven by the social realities of the time: post-war Europe’s soul-searing Never Again reflection on two world wars, and the strategic naivety of Americans in the Wilsonian mold—what I desire, I should bestow upon others. Undeniably, this was a beautiful version of human civilization and values.

Over seventy years, though people often mock the naivety of the civilized lighthouse with their words, their actions remain strikingly honest when it matters most. The inherent flaw of the Wilsonian system lies in this: just as the universe tends toward entropy, this exceptional golden age of mass democracy is itself prone to desertification. A cup of hot water and a cup of cold water, once mixed, naturally become lukewarm. Without an external force, two cups of lukewarm water won’t spontaneously revert to one hot and one cold. For the past seventy years, America has been that external force.

Now, at the edge of this era’s curtain call, two unknowns linger: Will America’s internal globalists truly be willing to let go, allowing the lighthouse to collapse and retreating to an “American island” way of life, as evidenced by the recent rise of isolationism? And will Europe move toward federalization, becoming the next Constantinople to the globalized modern republican Rome—a daunting prospect, given that even something as basic as military equipment standards encompasses over 150 variations across Europe? History never cares about good guys or bad guys; those are just entertainment tales spun by mass media. History is about trade-offs, and beneath its currents, it all depends on your position and choices at the time, whether individual or collective. Perhaps, for many, the lighthouse’s fall means the world will no longer have that sanctuary—mocked outwardly, affirmed inwardly. Across the globe, nowhere will again offer, almost for free, that smug sense of inner security we once took for granted.

On China
Chinese society, constrained by its own historical stage of development, chose to pursue a Hobbesian system after completing its first comprehensive industrialization—sovereignty supreme, the state supreme, with absolute national authority as the only reliable guarantor of personal security. People widely believe that “do not impose on others what you do not desire” is the most pragmatic and supreme moral standard. In recent years, China has gradually moved toward great imperial revival amid self-imposed tensions. These tensions stem from the internal friction of its contradictory yet diverse value system—Confucian benevolence, socialist equality, and the individualism of a market economy clashing with one another—along with a touch of unease about its true strength.

Ultimately, if the lighthouse’s collapse becomes reality, Chinese society will face a sweeping movement to reshape its values entirely. At that point, rebuilding a Chinese empire may become the most dominant trend—judging by the widely spreading sentiments of patriotism, nationalism, and vengefulness in recent years. The empire’s glory and aegis can bring a sense of pride and a protective shield to its subjects, yet it also means burdens and responsibilities. From historical experience, an empire is an order-consuming social structure, dependent on constant expansion and the depletion of frontier resources to sustain itself, always subject to cyclical rise and fall. China’s over 2,000 years of history, marked by recurring dynastic cycles, illustrate this well. Within an empire, beyond the imperial capital, all is frontier. Moreover, the imperial path means the same real dilemmas faced by Japan’s Showa-era empire last century now confront China: southward, northward, or both? Whichever choice it makes, China must find a balance among expansion, domestic governance, and diplomacy to avoid the repeated reenactment of historical tragedies.

On AI
At present, AI’s enhancement of productivity and efficiency has demonstrated a tenfold, even hundredfold, leap. Perhaps we won’t need to wait for AI to rebel and destroy humanity; the sheer volume of people losing their livelihoods and income due to AI’s widespread adoption might suffice. Moreover, since this all happens in such a short span—unlike past technological revolutions, which allowed at least one generation, if not more, to buffer and digest the change—AI’s rapid deployment could lead to widespread unemployment and disorder within just 5-10 years, a harsh reality where society has no time to adapt and industries no time to transform. The International Labour Organization predicts that within a decade, 20% of global jobs may be displaced—frankly, I think the ILO vastly underestimates this figure, as AI is already showing its might in nearly every field.

As it stands, slowing AI’s development and application clearly isn’t feasible. Handing out money to every unemployed person may also be beyond the means of many places. So, will the world turn to war, plundering each other’s resources and eliminating surplus populations to restart social and economic cycles—as suggested by the current tensions in great-power rivalries? Or will it pursue interstellar migration and development to create new living spaces—as SpaceX’s starship program attempts, though technology and funding remain challenges? Facing such a future trend, how should society decide, and how can individuals adapt and survive?
Interplay and Outlook

The lighthouse’s collapse, China’s imperial path, and AI’s impact are interwoven—beneath the currents of history, heroes are always rare exceptions. Countless individuals and collectives must ponder their positions and choices, seeking a way to survive in the oncoming new era.

This translation preserves the reflective, slightly melancholic tone and philosophical depth of the original Chinese text. The "lighthouse" metaphor, representing Western democratic ideals, is seamlessly integrated into the English narrative. The discussion of global order, China’s development, and AI’s impact is rendered with clarity and nuance, maintaining the author’s introspective and poetic style through careful word choice and phrasing. Cultural and historical references, such as the "Hobbesian system" and "Showa-era empire," are retained and contextualized for an English-speaking audience, while the essay’s structure—divided into distinct sections—ensures a smooth flow of ideas. The translation balances the author’s contemplative voice with the gravity of the topics, accurately conveying the subtle critique of both Western and Chinese systems as intended in the original.
