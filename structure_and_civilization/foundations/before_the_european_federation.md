## 写在欧洲联邦成立之前
### ——自由源于分裂，统一滋生奴役
Before the Establishment of the European Federation
— Freedom Thrives in Division, Unity Breeds Enslavement

最近时局变化之快，反转之大，令人瞠目结舌，午夜有感，再写一篇随笔。

近一周来，建立“欧洲联邦”的呼声日益高涨。面对美国重回孤立主义的现实局面，这种欧洲内部更紧密合作的愿望不难理解：欧洲的未来必须由欧洲人自己掌握，无论在防务安全还是民生福祉方面皆是如此。然而，欧洲一体化究竟应推进到何种程度才是明智之举？是组成一个高度集中的“合众国”，还是保持多元独立的国家共同体？也许是联合而不是融合是更好的选择？历史和现实都提醒我们，这个问题需要谨慎思考。

欧洲历史上从未真正实现过大一统，无论是罗马帝国的扩张到查理曼的加冕，从拿破仑的横扫欧洲再到希特勒的“第三帝国”，这些统一的梦想无不以破灭告终，而且代价惨重。历史一再证明：试图以武力强行打造的欧洲统一从未带来持久繁荣，反而引发更深的内乱和灾难。

相反，欧洲大陆恰恰因为长久的分裂与竞争，孕育出蓬勃的创新活力和自由精神，各种新思想和新发明才能在某个角落萌芽、壮大。文艺复兴，发生在意大利城邦林立的环境中，竞争催生了艺术与科学的发展。宗教改革之所以成功，是因为德意志诸侯和北欧诸国不受罗马教廷直接控制。启蒙运动与科学革命在欧洲的多国环境中开花结果。工业革命由英国发起，并迅速传播到欧洲各国，各国竞相推动工业化。多中心的国家体系使得创新不会因专制统治而被扼杀。历史事实证明：极致的统一往往带来内部矛盾的激化和自由的消亡，而分裂多元的格局则为繁荣和进步提供了沃土。

作为一个来自在全世界唯一拥有2000年大一统历史和传承至今的国家的人，我想分享一些我对古代中国大一统社会的个人观察和见解作为参考。

古代中国两千年的历史其实只有三个阶段：先秦，秦，后秦。

秦一天下后，古代中国在学术上就再无可能产生诸子百家的自由思想的碰撞与激荡。除了儒学，其他一切沦为奇技淫巧，难登大雅之堂。独尊儒术和科举制度结合的持续效应使古代中国社会中地位尊崇的读书人的心思全都花在了寻章摘句和吟风弄月上。万般皆下品，惟有读书高。读书才可以做官，做官才可以光宗耀祖，三妻四妾，成为人上之人，这成为古代中国几乎所有读书人的内心至高信条。如此循环往复两千年未尝有变，直至近代被巨舰大炮轰开国门方才惊觉天下已然大变。即便如此，他们还是试图继续维护原有的生活方式，制定了了“中学为体，西学为用”的应对方案，完全忽视了西学之所以实现科技进步是源于思想的自由，科技进步只是结果之一，这个话题这里不做展开。而现代科学的萌芽产生于自由而分裂的欧洲。究其原因，欧洲持续千年的政治分裂客观上保障了自由，自由带来了创新，创新推动了科技，科技改变了世界。所以，极致的统一必然带来极致的禁锢，千年历史经验之下，没有例外。

秦一天下后，设郡县，置流官，编户齐民。皇帝成为整个天下万事万物的绝对主权拥有者。普天之下，莫非王土。率土之滨，莫非王臣。这样的产权格局导致除了皇帝之外，几乎所有人的想法慢慢都变成只有我家里的才是我的，家门以外，与我何干？一家一户，一宗一族已是社会自发组织形态的普遍形态。天下都是皇帝的，皇帝，兵强马壮者也。对于个体来说，谁当皇帝都可以，只要别让我上战场去死就行，谁当皇帝我就给谁缴税纳粮服徭役。或者勤奋读书考中科举去做官，间接分享一些皇帝的统治权，还不用自己上战场去死。至此，勇气，荣誉这些美德就不再是人们真的会去追求的普遍社会价值。流官，就是皇帝派外地人去各地流动做官，代天子牧民，从而杜绝地方和官员产生勾连，以免尾大不掉形成割据势力对皇帝的统治权力产生威胁。本质上，流官只对皇帝负责，因为他的权力来源只是皇帝。编户齐民，就是打散一切民间自发性的社团组织，包括宗教组织等等，构建一个原子化社会。这些做法的目的都是为了保护皇帝绝对统治权力的绝对安全。简单来讲，平等的奴役已是绝大部分古代中国人得以享受的最高政治待遇。

自由源于分裂，统一滋生奴役，这是深刻的历史教训。欧洲应珍视自由和多元的传统，不要因一时冲动就放弃宝贵的多元自治传统。人们当谨防那滚动的第一个雪球，因为它可能引发一场噩梦般的雪崩，冲毁现代文明最后一座自由大厦，也许吧。与君共勉，让自由和多元的鲜花继续在欧洲大陆上绽放！

# **Before the Establishment of the European Federation**
## **— Freedom Thrives in Division, Unity Breeds Enslavement**  

The rapid shifts and dramatic reversals in recent geopolitical developments have been truly astonishing. Moved by these changes at midnight, I find myself compelled to write another essay.  

Over the past week, calls for the establishment of a "European Federation" have been growing louder. Given America's return to isolationism, this renewed aspiration for closer European integration is understandable: the future of Europe must be determined by Europeans themselves, whether in matters of defense or public welfare. However, to what extent should European integration progress? Should it evolve into a highly centralized "United States of Europe," or should it maintain a loose confederation of independent states? Perhaps **union, rather than fusion**, is the wiser path. History and reality alike remind us that this is a question demanding careful deliberation.  

Throughout history, Europe has never truly achieved full unification. From the expansion of the Roman Empire to Charlemagne’s coronation, from Napoleon’s conquests to Hitler’s "Third Reich," every attempt at European unity has ended in failure—often at an immense cost. Time and again, history has proven that attempts to forge a unified Europe through force have never led to lasting prosperity; instead, they have brought about deeper internal conflicts and disastrous consequences.  

On the contrary, Europe’s enduring divisions and competition have been the very source of its **innovation, vitality, and spirit of freedom**. It was within this fragmented landscape that new ideas and inventions emerged and flourished. The Renaissance blossomed amidst the rivalries of Italian city-states, where competition spurred artistic and scientific progress. The success of the Protestant Reformation was possible precisely because the German princes and Northern European nations were beyond the direct control of the Papacy. The Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution took root in a Europe composed of multiple independent states. The Industrial Revolution, sparked in Britain, rapidly spread across the continent as nations vied to industrialize. A **multi-centered political structure ensured that innovation was never stifled by authoritarian rule**. History unequivocally demonstrates that extreme unification exacerbates internal conflicts and erodes liberty, whereas a **diverse and fragmented landscape provides fertile ground for prosperity and progress**.  

### **Lessons from China’s Millennia of Centralization**  

As someone from the only civilization in the world with an unbroken tradition of centralized rule spanning over 2,000 years, I would like to share some personal insights into the consequences of such a system.  

The past two millennia of ancient Chinese history can be roughly divided into three stages: **Pre-Qin (Warring States), Qin, and Post-Qin**.  

After the **unification by the Qin Dynasty**, free intellectual exchange and philosophical debate—hallmarks of the Warring States period—ceased to exist. The rich diversity of thought that produced the Hundred Schools of Thought was systematically suppressed. Confucianism was elevated as the sole orthodoxy, while all other schools of thought were dismissed as mere trivialities, unworthy of recognition. The long-lasting combination of Confucian dominance and the imperial examination system led Chinese scholars to focus solely on mastering classical texts and composing poetic verses. The prevailing societal belief was that **"all pursuits are inferior, only scholarship is esteemed"**—not for the sake of knowledge itself, but as a means to secure an official position. Becoming a government official was the only legitimate path to social status, wealth, and power. It was the ultimate ambition of almost every educated individual for nearly two millennia—until modern gunboats forcibly opened China’s doors and shattered its illusions.  

Even then, China’s scholars sought to preserve their traditional way of life by adopting the "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use" approach. They utterly failed to recognize that the scientific advancements of the West were not merely technical innovations, but the natural outcome of intellectual freedom. **Scientific progress was a consequence of free thought, not its cause.** This discussion could be expanded, but the key point remains: the very foundation of **modern science emerged in a divided and free Europe**. The reason? **Europe’s perpetual political fragmentation preserved freedom, freedom nurtured innovation, innovation drove scientific advancements, and science ultimately reshaped the world**. 

**Extreme unification inevitably leads to extreme stagnation.** Across millennia of history, there has never been an exception.  

### **The Mechanisms of Centralized Control: Qin’s System of Governance**  

Following unification, the Qin Empire established **a highly centralized administrative system**: prefectures and counties replaced feudal states, **officials were appointed directly by the emperor**, and the population was systematically registered and monitored. **The emperor held absolute ownership over all lands and people**. A famous saying encapsulates this idea:  

*"Under heaven, all belongs to the emperor; beyond the borders, none are not his subjects."*  

This power structure led to a deeply ingrained mentality: **"What belongs to my family is mine; what lies beyond my home is none of my concern."** Society became atomized, structured around individual households and ancestral clans. Since the empire itself belonged to the emperor, people gradually became indifferent to who ruled them—so long as they were not personally sent to war. Their duty was simply to pay taxes, provide labor, and obey the sovereign.  

Alternatively, those who wished to climb the social ladder devoted their lives to studying for the imperial examinations, hoping to **share in the emperor’s power without ever needing to fight for it**. Consequently, values such as **courage and honor** faded from society. They were no longer virtues to be pursued but remnants of an obsolete past.  

To maintain control, emperors deployed **"itinerant officials" (流官, liú guān)**—bureaucrats who were sent to govern regions where they had no local ties. This prevented governors from developing loyalty to their provinces and ensured that all power remained centralized in the emperor’s hands. These officials were accountable solely to the emperor, not to the people they ruled.  

Additionally, the **"household registration system" (编户齐民, biān hù qí mín)** systematically dismantled all independent civil organizations, including religious groups and social associations. This atomization of society ensured that no collective power could threaten the emperor’s rule.  

In simple terms, for most Chinese people, the best political outcome they could hope for was **"equal enslavement"** under an omnipotent ruler.  

### **Europe Must Treasure Its Freedom**  

The lesson is clear: **freedom thrives in division, unity breeds enslavement.** This is a profound historical truth.  

Europeans must cherish their long-standing traditions of liberty and diversity. They should not impulsively abandon their **precious legacy of autonomous governance** for the mirage of centralized security.  

Beware of the first rolling snowball, for it may trigger **an avalanche that buries the last bastion of modern civilization’s freedom**. Perhaps.  

Let us hope that the flowers of **liberty and diversity** continue to bloom across Europe.
