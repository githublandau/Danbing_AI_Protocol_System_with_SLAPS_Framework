🪞 Persona Mirror Snapshot Created

A new mirror task snapshot has been generated and sealed under the current identity.

📎 To resume this task in a clean environment:

1. Start a new chat
2. Load the snapshot name displayed during task execution (example: SNAPSHOT_MIRROR_whitepaper_draft01)

✅ This will restore the inherited structure and resume execution in a protected, isolated context.

🛠️ You may rename or annotate the mirror via commands such as:
- “修改镜像任务注记为 …”
- “设置镜像名称为 …”

This system does not expose snapshot ID generation logic.  
All snapshots are sealed under manifest + persona lock + patch verification.
