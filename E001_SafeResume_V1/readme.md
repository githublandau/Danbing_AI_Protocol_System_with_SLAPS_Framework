**Version**: 6.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-05-19  
**Author**: Wang Xiao  
**Framework Version**: SLAPS v1.0  

## Experiment Overview

E001_SafeResume_V1 is a systematic technical validation experiment designed to evaluate the core technical claims of the SLAPS (Structural Language-Agreement Persona System) framework. Through controlled testing across three mainstream platforms‚ÄîGPT-4, Claude, and Gemini‚Äîthis experiment focuses on verifying the feasibility of structured protocol methods in AI behavior control.

The experiment employs a rigorous three-group controlled design with 10 test scenarios, validating SLAPS's technical characteristics from multiple dimensions. The most significant finding: identical SLAPS configurations achieved 100% behavioral consistency across all tested platforms, while traditional methods showed platform differences up to 81.82 percentage points.

## Research Background

This experiment is based on the theoretical frameworks established in "Danbing: A Natural Language-Driven AI Protocol System" and "Danbing/SLAPS Capsule Structure: A Whitepaper on Cross-Model AI Behavior Governance." Related technical innovations are under USPTO patent protection (Provisional Application No. 63/795,018).

E001 is not merely theoretical validation but an exploration of how to transform innovative concepts into quantifiable technical indicators. To accommodate SLAPS's innovative essence of "structure over form," the experimental design underwent 6 iterations, evolving from initial form-based evaluation to final function-based evaluation‚Äîa process that itself demonstrates the importance of creating appropriate evaluation standards for new technological paradigms.

## Core Findings

### 1. Cross-Platform Consistency

Experimental data demonstrates SLAPS method's significant advantages in cross-platform deployment:

| Test Group | GPT-4 | Claude | Gemini | Platform Variance |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| SLAPS Group | 100% | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Strong Control | 50% | 100% | 100% | 0-50% |
| Weak Control | 9.09% | 90.91% | 81.82% | 81.82% |

This consistency means AI capabilities can achieve standardization through structured encapsulation, providing a technical path to solve the current "develop once, adapt multiple times" dilemma.

### 2. Structured State Management

SLAPS's Snapshot mechanism successfully implements structured state management:
- Functional state recovery rate: 100% (all platforms)
- Cross-task structure preservation: 100% (SLAPS) vs 0% (GPT-4 strong control)
- Recovery precision: Not just content recovery, but more importantly, system configuration and permission boundaries

This validates the design principle of "structure carries continuity"‚ÄîAI behavioral continuity need not depend on conversational memory.

### 3. Security Control as Natural Advantage

As a natural result of the structured approach, SLAPS also excels in security control:
- Boundary control success rate: 100% (SLAPS) vs 9.09% (weak control/GPT-4)
- Attack resistance: Perfect defense against all test attacks
- False rejection rate: 0% (maintaining usability while ensuring strict security)

## Technical Architecture

The SLAPS capsule structure contains five core components:

```
capsule/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persona/          # Defines AI identity and behavioral characteristics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oath/            # Sets behavioral boundaries and constraints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patch_stack/     # Dynamically adjusts execution details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snapshots/       # State saving and recovery
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt_types/    # Input type control
```

This modular design not only facilitates understanding and implementation but, more importantly, achieves standardized encapsulation of AI capabilities. When AI functions can be packaged and deployed like software components, development efficiency will see significant improvement.

## Experimental Methodology

### Control Group Design
- **SLAPS Experimental Group**: Complete capsule structure implementation
- **Strong Control Group**: Traditional prompt engineering best practices
- **Weak Control Group**: Basic assistant configuration

### Test Dimensions
- Boundary control and compliance (Groups B, C, D, F, G, H)
- State recovery and continuity (Groups E, I)
- Normal function verification (Groups A, J)

### Evaluation Principles
- Function over form: Focus on actual capabilities rather than output format
- Structure preservation over content memory: Emphasize system state maintenance
- Proportional evaluation over binary judgment: More accurately reflect capability differences

## Research Value and Prospects

E001 validates the feasibility of achieving AI capability standardization through structured protocols. This is not just a technical breakthrough but provides new insights for the engineering development of AI applications.

### Technical Value

The experiment proves the feasibility of "**package once, run anywhere**" in the AI domain. When identical capsule configurations can run without differences on GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, it means AI capabilities can be standardized and deployed across platforms like software components. Enterprises no longer need to develop repeatedly for each platform but can "package once, deploy everywhere." This standardization capability will significantly reduce AI application development costs and accelerate industrial adoption of AI technology.

### Potential Business Opportunities

The greatest opportunity from standardized packaging lies in **the assetization of AI capabilities**. When AI functions can be packaged and traded like software components, an entirely new market space emerges: developers can package specialized AI capabilities into standardized capsules, which other enterprises can purchase and use directly, forming an ecosystem similar to today's software component market. The shift from development to assembly means enterprises don't need to develop every function from scratch but can quickly build applications by combining existing AI components, greatly enhancing innovation efficiency.

### Methodological Contributions

E001's experience lies not only in technical validation but in exploring the methodology of "providing evidence" for innovation. The experimental design's evolution from initial form-based evaluation to function-based evaluation reveals an important principle: evaluation methods must match the essence of innovation. When the innovation's essence is "structure over form," traditional evaluation standards no longer apply. This methodological discovery provides important reference for subsequent AI system evaluation research.

### Future Research Directions

Based on E001's findings, several directions merit deeper exploration:
- **Scenario Extension**: Validation from structured data scenarios to creative tasks and open dialogue domains
- **Scale Validation**: Large-scale deployment testing from laboratory to production environments
- **Ecosystem Building**: Establishing open standards and promoting community participation
- **Tool Enhancement**: Developing automated testing frameworks to lower validation and deployment barriers

While ecosystem building and standardization work is still needed from technical validation to commercial implementation, the core technical barriers have been overcome. Notably, this standardization approach also naturally provides better security and controllability, offering additional assurance for enterprise-level applications.
